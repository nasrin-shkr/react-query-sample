# RQ-Sample

This is a sample project that demonstrates how to use React Query (RQ) with Axios and JSON Server in a React app built using Vite.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine and then run `yarn install` to install the dependencies.

To start the development server, run:

`yarn dev`

Vite uses a different strategy for serving the app during development. Instead of using a traditional development server like other tools, Vite uses a built-in development server that serves the app from memory.

To access the app during development, open your web browser and navigate to the URL displayed in the console after running `yarn dev`. It should be something like `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:3001`.

To build the app for production, run:

`yarn build`

This will generate a production-ready build in the `dist` directory.

## Scripts

This project includes several scripts that you can run using Yarn. Here are the available scripts:

- `dev`: Starts the development server.
- `build`: Builds the app for production.
- `lint`: Lints the source code using ESLint.
- `preview`: Builds and previews the production build.
- `serve-json`: Starts the JSON server on port 4000.
